                NO. Nature’s Best Relief products do not contain THC, 
                the part of marijuana plant that gets you high. Our 
                hemp products are perfectly legal in ALL 50 STATES. 
                You will never have to worry about our products and 
                drug testing. Our Pain Creams, lotions, and our high 
                strength Hemp oil products are designed for law 
                enforcement, military, CDL license holders, pilots 
                and anyone who worries about being randomly tested. 
                Stop worrying, we have you covered. Every product we 
                sell has a lot number and batch number on it. There 
                is no way anything can slip in and cause a positive 
                test result. If you ever fail a drug test, it wasn’t 
                because of us. This is watched by the FDA and we have 
                all of our products frequently lab tested, both by us 
                and by independent labs to ensure that what you see is 
                what you get.

              <h3 class="mobile-h3">Can you get high from Nature's Best Relief Products?</h3>
              <p class="content-text">
                Absolutely not. Period. You will never get “high” from 
                our products. Hemp does not contain THC. It is 
                impossible to get high from Nature’s Best Relief because 
                all of our products are made from hemp, not marijuana.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let us explain. Are there Hemp products that have THC in 
                them? I’m sure you have seen reports about strains of 
                marijuana like Charlotte’s Web and CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta. 
                Can you buy that? Yes, but you have to get them in Medical 
                / Recreational Marijuana stores in states where it is legal. 
                We are in Colorado and we at the forefront of this 
                legislation. You would have to obtain a Medical marijuana 
                license to purchase them legally. The hemp plant and the 
                marijuana plant are very similar as they are both a member 
                of the cannabis family, yet they are very different. There 
                is almost an infinite number of strains. It is very much the 
                same as roses. There are many different colors and styles and 
                different degrees of variation. Is there any THC in our 
                products? Yes, but the amount is so small we do not have to 
                register it. We are at .03%. (That’s 3/100 of 1 percent) Think 
                of non-alcoholic beer and wine. Is there alcohol in them? 
                Absolutely, but just like us the amount is so small it is 
                virtually undetectable.

              <h3 class="mobile-h3">Do you need THC in Hemp products to make them work?</h3>
              <p class="content-text">
                NO. Hemp oil has wonderful effects on the body. There are 
                studies on how Hemp’s healing properties work without any 
                THC. More and more testing is being done everyday and we 
                will keep you up to date on this as results are published. 
                We have tested our products against THC strains and have 
                consistently tested higher in Hemp than marijuana products. 
                If you doubt us, grab your THC products and send them to an 
                independent lab side by side against ours. That’s a bold 
                statement and we are sure there may be products out there 
                that test higher in Hemp than ours, but so far we haven’t 
                found them.
                <br>
                <br>
                We are in beautiful Colorado which has legal recreational 
                marijuana as well as medical marijuana. There is good hemp 
                here as well, but the law will not allow us to cross state 
                lines with it. Our hemp in imported from some the finest hemp 
                we can find, it is an ultra pure strain of hemp. Sure, we 
                have tested Hemp strains from southeast Asia, Eastern block 
                countries, Europe and even Canada. We will always find the 
                highest strain we can. We ARE Nature’s Best Relief for a 
                reason. That is why we are legal in ALL 50 STATES.
                <br>
                <br>
                So relax, do an internet search on Hemp and how it helps the 
                body naturally. We’ll be here waiting.

              <p class="content-text">
                There is a BIG difference between regular hemp oil 
                and our Hemp oil. Our industrial hemp strain is 
                specifically grown to have a spike registering a high 
                strain of Hemp. Standard Hemp oil is like olive oil, 
                but from hemp. What is the difference between the two?
                <br>
                <br>
                Let’s start with the basics. If you grow low grade hemp, 
                you should make a rope, a bag or a T-shirt. It’s 
                worthless to us. We ONLY deal in high grade and ultra 
                high grade hemp. We are not here to get anyone high. You 
                can find that easily enough on your own. We are here to 
                help people. Let me further explain: Hemp oil can be used 
                as an ingredient in cooking, used to make plastic, paper, 
                paint, biofuel, and serves numerous medical purposes. 
                Please poke around and learn more. We stand behind our 
                products.

              <p class="content-text">
                HEMP can come from the stem of a marijuana plant 
                or hemp plant. But just because it can come from 
                a hemp plant doesn’t mean it is the same as Hemp 
                oil. Using scientific “evolution” of the plant, 
                we are able to raise the HEMP and lower the THC.

              <p class="content-text">
                The HEMP in Nature’s Best Relief used in our 
                creams, lotions and tincture products comes 
                from cold pressed hemp, legally grown and 
                imported. Hemp is legal to “grow” in many 
                nations including ours, but currently only 
                in selective states in the USA. The HEMP is 
                extracted using the most modern extraction 
                processes available. Extremely complex and 
                expensive equipment is used to extract the 
                THC from the high HEMP extract. Thus, our 
                HEMP extract has no THC. The high HEMP 
                content oil is then imported legally into the 
                USA. It is manufactured in our state of the 
                art modern lab, here in the US. We follow all 
                USA government standards in producing our 
                tincture, cream and powdered product. The 
                products are legal to own, sell or distribute 
                in all 50 states without a medical card or 
                permit.

              <p class="content-text">
                Our Nature’s Best Relief tincture (oil) can be used two 
                ways; as an oral supplement or applied topically. You 
                can add a few drops to your effected area and massage 
                into your skin (dermis and epidermis). Nature’s Best 
                Relief pain cream is only applied topically. Taken 
                internally, the HEMP oil benefits your entire system 
                but the effects are not immediately noticeable. Applied 
                topically, both the oil and the pain cream should provide 
                fairly immediate relief.

              <p class="content-text">
                Every person is different and lots of factors 
                come into play, but here are some general rules. 
                Let’s start with the basics. How much did you 
                take? You can’t take too much because it is all 
                natural. A lot times more than a few drops is 
                overdoing it. Think of it like blood pressure 
                meds. You have to build them up slowly. The rule 
                of thumb is that you listen to your body. If you 
                need more, take more. If you are doing good, 
                start backing it down. We have many customers 
                that state that it lasts all day. Others just a 
                few hours. It all depends on you. The shelf life 
                or our products is usually up to 2 1/2 years. 
                Please be aware, however, as we stated above, 
                HEMP will dissipate if exposed to heat for long 
                periods of time.

                Pain Cream – Apply 1/2 the size of a dime on top 
                of the area that hurts or has discomfort. We have 
                a natural camphor menthol in our Pain Cream. 
                Whether you like the smell or not, it will 
                evaporate in 10-30 minutes. We are not in the 
                camphor menthol business. We just want it to open 
                up the pores so our high strain HEMP can get in 
                there. We WANT it to evaporate. If you have skin

                Skin Lotion – This is the same formula as our pain

                fuel”. It all starts here and this is the basis 
                from which we make all of our products. It works 
                great on humans and pets. It’s best to start off 
                strong. Listen to your body. If you need more, take 
                more. You can’t take too much, you can only run out. 
                Start with 1-5 drops under the tongue and let it sit 
                there for 15-45 seconds. The reason for this is to 
                get it into your blood stream as quickly as possible 
                via the two veins under your tongue. (remember, it’s 
                like nitro glycerin for heart attacks) The better the 
                strain, the smaller the molecule. The smaller the 
                molecule, the faster it absorbs. Our HEMP oil is a 
                very high strain. It works quickly. How long does 
                ibuprofen take to kick in? This should be about the 
                same. If you are adding it to food or beverages it may 
                take a little longer because it has to get absorbed 
                through your stomach lining. If you have specific 
                questions, drop us a line or check us out on Facebook 
                or other social media.

                the part of marijuana plant that gets you high. Our

              <h3>Can you get high from Nature's Best Relief Products?</h3>
              <p class="content-text">
                Absolutely not. Period. You will never get “high” from 
                our products. Hemp does not contain THC. It is 
                impossible to get high from Nature’s Best Relief because 
                all of our products are made from hemp, not marijuana.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let us explain. Are there Hemp products that have THC in 
                them? I’m sure you have seen reports about strains of 
                marijuana like Charlotte’s Web and CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta. 
                Can you buy that? Yes, but you have to get them in Medical 
                / Recreational Marijuana stores in states where it is legal. 
                We are in Colorado and we at the forefront of this 
                legislation. You would have to obtain a Medical marijuana 
                license to purchase them legally. The hemp plant and the 
                marijuana plant are very similar as they are both a member 
                of the cannabis family, yet they are very different. There 
                is almost an infinite number of strains. It is very much the 
                same as roses. There are many different colors and styles and 
                different degrees of variation. Is there any THC in our 
                products? Yes, but the amount is so small we do not have to 
                register it. We are at .03%. (That’s 3/100 of 1 percent) Think 
                of non-alcoholic beer and wine. Is there alcohol in them? 
                Absolutely, but just like us the amount is so small it is 
                virtually undetectable.

              <h3>Do you need THC in Hemp products to make them work?</h3>
              <p class="content-text">
                NO. Hemp oil has wonderful effects on the body. There are 
                studies on how Hemp’s healing properties work without any 
                THC. More and more testing is being done everyday and we 
                will keep you up to date on this as results are published. 
                We have tested our products against THC strains and have 
                consistently tested higher in Hemp than marijuana products. 
                If you doubt us, grab your THC products and send them to an 
                independent lab side by side against ours. That’s a bold 
                statement and we are sure there may be products out there 
                that test higher in Hemp than ours, but so far we haven’t 
                found them.
                <br>
                <br>
                We are in beautiful Colorado which has legal recreational 
                marijuana as well as medical marijuana. There is good hemp 
                here as well, but the law will not allow us to cross state 
                lines with it. Our hemp in imported from some the finest hemp 
                we can find, it is an ultra pure strain of hemp. Sure, we 
                have tested Hemp strains from southeast Asia, Eastern block 
                countries, Europe and even Canada. We will always find the 
                highest strain we can. We ARE Nature’s Best Relief for a 
                reason. That is why we are legal in ALL 50 STATES.
                <br>
                <br>
                So relax, do an internet search on Hemp and how it helps the 
                body naturally. We’ll be here waiting.

              <h3>What makes our Hemp oil different?</h3>
              <p class="content-text">
                There is a BIG difference between regular hemp oil 
                and our Hemp oil. Our industrial hemp strain is 
                specifically grown to have a spike registering a high 
                strain of Hemp. Standard Hemp oil is like olive oil, 
                but from hemp. What is the difference between the two?
                <br>
                <br>
                Let’s start with the basics. If you grow low grade hemp, 
                you should make a rope, a bag or a T-shirt. It’s 
                worthless to us. We ONLY deal in high grade and ultra 
                high grade hemp. We are not here to get anyone high. You 
                can find that easily enough on your own. We are here to 
                help people. Let me further explain: Hemp oil can be used 
                as an ingredient in cooking, used to make plastic, paper, 
                paint, biofuel, and serves numerous medical purposes. 
                Please poke around and learn more. We stand behind our 
                products.

              <h3>Where does HEMP come from?</h3>
              <p class="content-text">
                HEMP can come from the stem of a marijuana plant 
                or hemp plant. But just because it can come from 
                a hemp plant doesn’t mean it is the same as Hemp 
                oil. Using scientific “evolution” of the plant, 
                we are able to raise the HEMP and lower the THC.

              <h3>Is HEMP Legal?</h3>
              <p class="content-text">
                The HEMP in Nature’s Best Relief used in our 
                creams, lotions and tincture products comes 
                from cold pressed hemp, legally grown and 
                imported. Hemp is legal to “grow” in many 
                nations including ours, but currently only 
                in selective states in the USA. The HEMP is 
                extracted using the most modern extraction 
                processes available. Extremely complex and 
                expensive equipment is used to extract the 
                THC from the high HEMP extract. Thus, our 
                HEMP extract has no THC. The high HEMP 
                content oil is then imported legally into the 
                USA. It is manufactured in our state of the 
                art modern lab, here in the US. We follow all 
                USA government standards in producing our 
                tincture, cream and powdered product. The 
                products are legal to own, sell or distribute 
                in all 50 states without a medical card or 
                permit.

              <h3>What is the difference between the HEMP tincture and the HEMP cream?</h3>
              <p class="content-text">
                Our Nature’s Best Relief tincture (oil) can be used two 
                ways; as an oral supplement or applied topically. You 
                can add a few drops to your effected area and massage 
                into your skin (dermis and epidermis). Nature’s Best 
                Relief pain cream is only applied topically. Taken 
                internally, the HEMP oil benefits your entire system 
                but the effects are not immediately noticeable. Applied 
                topically, both the oil and the pain cream should provide 
                fairly immediate relief.

              <p class="content-text">
                Every person is different and lots of factors 
                come into play, but here are some general rules. 
                Let’s start with the basics. How much did you 
                take? You can’t take too much because it is all 
                natural. A lot times more than a few drops is 
                overdoing it. Think of it like blood pressure 
                meds. You have to build them up slowly. The rule 
                of thumb is that you listen to your body. If you 
                need more, take more. If you are doing good, 
                start backing it down. We have many customers 
                that state that it lasts all day. Others just a 
                few hours. It all depends on you. The shelf life 
                or our products is usually up to 2 1/2 years. 
                Please be aware, however, as we stated above, 
                HEMP will dissipate if exposed to heat for long 
                periods of time.

              <p class="content-text">
                Pain Cream – Apply 1/2 the size of a dime on top 
                of the area that hurts or has discomfort. We have 
                a natural camphor menthol in our Pain Cream. 
                Whether you like the smell or not, it will 
                evaporate in 10-30 minutes. We are not in the 
                camphor menthol business. We just want it to open 
                up the pores so our high strain HEMP can get in 
                there. We WANT it to evaporate. If you have skin 
                irritation or an open wound, you probably should 
                be using our Nature’s Best Relief oil instead.
                <br>

                Skin Lotion – This is the same formula as our pain 
                cream, but without the added camphor menthol. It 
                is also good for pain, but it’s great for using as 
                a facial lotion, on your bikini line or as an all 
                natural lotion for new tattoos. This lotion is 
                perfect for anywhere on your body that you don’t 
                want to use camphor menthol.
                <br>
                <br>
                Organic Extra Virgin HEMP oil – This is our “rocket 
                fuel”. It all starts here and this is the basis 
                from which we make all of our products. It works 
                great on humans and pets. It’s best to start off 
                strong. Listen to your body. If you need more, take 
                more. You can’t take too much, you can only run out. 
                Start with 1-5 drops under the tongue and let it sit 
                there for 15-45 seconds. The reason for this is to 
                get it into your blood stream as quickly as possible 
                via the two veins under your tongue. (remember, it’s 
                like nitro glycerin for heart attacks) The better the 
                strain, the smaller the molecule. The smaller the 
                molecule, the faster it absorbs. Our HEMP oil is a 
                very high strain. It works quickly. How long does 
                ibuprofen take to kick in? This should be about the 
                same. If you are adding it to food or beverages it may 
                take a little longer because it has to get absorbed 
                through your stomach lining. If you have specific 
                questions, drop us a line or check us out on Facebook 
                or other social media.
